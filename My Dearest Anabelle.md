	sometimes i think it's even more than that

	a-na-belle, i beg you to be kind,

	so please do tell me and i'm gonna try

		  C                              G        D7
	and i'm trying my very best to keep you happy my dear

## Verse

	my dearest annabell, why would you talk bad about me?
	do you really hate the things that i brought

	i picked you flowers, wrap a gift, and wrote a card that says your name
	i wrote i just for you, come on that's sweet

## Chorus

## Bridge

	Dm            F                 C               G
	it's not like i'm a guy you could say wouldn't care
	what do you mean your name's not annabelle but claire

## Chorus

	my dearest annabelle, and by that i mean claire
	why the hell did you not tell me before?

	we've been dating for weeks and i've met all of your friends
	now it's clear to me why they acted this strange

	an-na-bell, damn, again i mean claire
	it's embarrassing when i recall our thing

	all these christmas cards, these christmas cards we sent to our friends
	no wonder i spent new years alone
