===============================

Capo VI

*Intro* (Ausklingen lassen)

	F C
	when you think
	F C
	this cannot happen to me
	Am Em
	that's when they grab you
	G
	by the balls

*Vers 1*

	C F
	well they call this an excuse
	C G
	though it's nothing but a line
	Am F G
	a story they made up to keep us down

	you'll only notice that you're screwed
	when they almost broke your spine
	so take a few steps back and look around

*Intermezzo* (1x mit ausklingen lassen, 1x voll gespielt)

	F C
	when you think
	F C
	it cannot get any worse
	F C
	that's when they grab you
	G
	by the balls

*Vers 2*

	well they make you think it's you
	who came up with the plan
	of doing overtime for deadlines sake

	it sucks to realize
	you might just be a piece
	inside a newton's cradle on a desk

*Vers 2*

	Am F C G
	oh this just came in - seems to be urgent
	oh we're so grateful it is you who's helping out tonite

	no kiddin' grateful? what about a raise though!
	so i'd take greater interest in what might come out
	one - i take your money, two - you take my soul
	three - you make me do things that disgust me to the bone
	i won't go into details - but sometimes i just wish
	to beat the living shit out of you

	G
	by the balls                       you a deal

*Refrain*

	C G F C
	they make you sign it here right below the dotted line
	F C G

	C G F C
