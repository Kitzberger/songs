	this cannot happen to me
	Am Em

	G
	by the balls

*Vers 1*

	C F
	well they call this an excuse
	C G
	though it's nothing but a line
	Am F G
	a story they made up to keep us down

	so take a few steps back and look around

*Vers 2*

	well they make you think it's you

	inside a newton's cradle on a desk

*Bridge*

	Am F C G
	oh this just came in - seems to be urgent
	oh we're so grateful it is you who's helping out tonite

	no kiddin' grateful? what about a raise though!
	so i'd take greater interest in what might come out

	one - i take your money, two - you take my soul
	three - you make me do things that disgust me to the bone

	i won't go into details - but sometimes i just wish
	to beat the living shit out of you
