## Vers 1

	     Am              Em              F            C
	you could've been a teacher if your parents were rich 
	     Am7/C           Fsus2     G
	you could've been a doctor by now 
	     Am              Em          F               C
	you could've been a rocket scientist and build space crafts 
	     Am7/C         Fsus2     G
	but you got fucked over somehow

## Pre-Chorus
	       F                        G
	well this is your day and i'm glad you made it 
	   C                 F
	to amsterdam in one piece 
	    F                      G
	if you were a rockstar and i mean a real one 
	       C                        F
	you'd be dead for almost three years 
	      G                          Am
	this means you're now considered old 
		      G               C
	time for the following to be told 

## Chorus
