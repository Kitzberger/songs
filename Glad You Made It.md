# Glad You Made It

Capo IV

## Intro

Am    Em    F     C
Am7/C Fsus2 G     G

## Verse

	the places that you've been to seem to slowly fade away
	the stories you once told are long gone
	i remember well this little song you taught us kids
	not to worry when we're feeling all alone

## Intermezzo

## Verse

	last time i came by you had a hard time figuring out
	who precisely i could be to you
	eventually you went with the name of our dog
	fine by me - i know she meant a lot to you

## Chorus

	 F                   G
	so you forgot a few details lately
	       C                            F
	that's OK, it's not the end of the world
	F                           G
	all the great minds have a lousy name memory
	    C                      F
	at least as far as i'm concerned
	   G                 Am
	i rarely remember anyone
	       G                 C
	like grandma, like grandson

## Intermezzo

## Verse

	it's weird when after years of education based on facts
	you find the world has seemingly gone mad
	surely there's always been a room for different views
	but honestly it never felt this bad
	
## Chorus

	so you don't follow the news reports lately
	that's OK - you must've heard it all before
	the facists of the past - back in the parliaments
	and they behave as if they've never heard of war
	stupid agitations, mean and loud
	kinda relieved you're slowly zoning out

## Intermezzo / Outro




----

## Chorus

	so you mistrust our commitment lately
	no you're not a burden not at all
	please rest assured your secret recipe
	it's safe with me - no, i won't ever tell a soul
	especially not that old hag from next door
	yes i remember we hate her to the core
