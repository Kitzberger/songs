### Verse

	D
	Twenty naked people off the coast of paradise
	G
	sitting in a tin can wearing glass as disguise
	D
	They booked a bloody cruise ship with their last few silver dimes
	G
	only to be rejected trying to cross the border line

### Chorus

	C F G D
	Why do you think (this is?)
	Why do you think (this is?)
	Why do you think (this is?)
	C F G
	Because it's always been like this!
	D
	Bull shit.

### Verse

	Twenty naked people on the beach of paradise
	getting free massages and gin tonic - extra ice
	a cloudless dream vacation - not a sign of poverty
	inside the fenced hotel - how much better could it be?
