# Pigeonhole

Capo 0

## Intro

	Gm D F#- Gm

## Verse

	the instance that i've heard your name
	is the very moment you became
	this fractured, tiny version
	of yourself

	but don't you put the blame on me
	the best intensions are hard to keep
	if you run into this pigeonhole
	by yourself

## Intermezzo

## Verse

	oh i have tried to pull you out again
	but you fight hard as you did back then
	...

## Refrain

	Cm Gm D Gm

	the more you know, the less you guess
	it's simple, just like that
