# Keeping Score

## Variant A

Capo 4

## Verse 1

	G
	talking about our latest fight
	C
	i am almost sure that i've won
	D
	but then you remind me keeping score when fighting
	D G
	is childish and really dumb

	of course you're right - I apologize
	we agree on no one's to blame
	but to make it worthwhile I open that file
	and put a strike next to your name

	F C C7 C7

## Verse 2

	there's one big ass vehicle
	that's blocking the bicycle lane
	don't feel frustrated because i know that later
	we're gonna take the train

	and then we're gonna report that prick
	to some hardcore bicyclists
	and they're gonna track him and probably smack in
	the side windows of his
	
## Refrain

	Am D Em A7

	we're on a quest for moral high ground
