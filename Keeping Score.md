	but to make it worthwhile I open that file
	and put a strike next to your name

## Verse 2

	there's one big ass vehicle
	that's blocking the bicycle lane
	i feel frustrated because i know later
	we're gonna miss the train

	but then I'm gonna report that prick
	to some cycling activists
	and they're gonna track him and probably smack in
	the side windows of his
