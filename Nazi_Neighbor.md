Nazi neighbor (21.04.2017)
==========================

Capo 3

### Refrain

	D7sus4
	                C               F
	what would you do if your nazi neighbor
	         G                   C
	came to you and asked for a favour?
	           Am            G             F         C
	would you lend him your hand or would you just slam
	     F           C           G
	the door in his face - au revoir?

### Vers

	         Am                        F           Em7                 G
	let's assume he wants to put up a solar panel right on top of his roof
	    Am                          F                   Em7                G
	and all he needs to do so is a helping hand from a good neighbor like you
	        F                        Am                         G                        C
	he'd be actively supporting the cause you believe in - the cause you believe in the most
	           F                        G                       C          (G)
	but is it really worth saving the planet? feels now kinda gross.

### Refrain

	                C                  F
	how would you choose if your nazi neighbor
	         G                   C
	came to you, asked you to a gay bar
	          Am         G              F         C
	would you accompany him, tryin' to be a good wing
	        F                 C         G
	man or would you think "what a clich√©?"

### Vers

	well, i guess it's kind of rough being a racist all day, especially if you are into men
	having to be tough, strong and hateful when all you think about is only big ben
	oh it would be a great deal of charity - and who can tell - maybe it's not too late
	and he'll reconsider his ways of thinking after finding a mate

### Bridge

	D7sus4                     G
	and when you say "break a leg"
	        F                            C
	do you honestly with all your heart hope he'll succeed?
	     Em7                        G
	not for the literal meaning instead?

### Refrain

	C F
	what would you do if your nazi neighbor
	G C
	wants to enroll his kid at your day care
	Am G F C
	would you be highly alarmed and call 'the antifa moms'
	F C G
	a club just to bully such kids?

### Vers

	well, let's assume he named his kid mussolini but it shows great talent in arts
	don't you think embrassing that innocent kid might prevent it from blackening his heart?
	so would you invite them over for play dates and make sure that all the other kids will come too
	you could then host a teeny-tiny bar mizwa even though you're not a jew

### Refrain (outro)

	C F
	what would you do if your nazi neighbor
	G C
	looked right into your turned off light saber
	Am G F C
	would you force-trigger it, causing his head to split
	F G C
	ok, that one's easy, I guess.
