==============================

Capo 4

### Vers 1

	C/G
	Baby, just let us go dancing
	F
	And forget all this shit for a while
	D7 G7
	We're sitting in front of the telly
	D7 G
	You burst into laughter, I cry

### Vers 2

	No, that doesn't mean I don't love you
	it's just that I'm feeling this urge
	to get out and see something different - for once
	so get dressed and grab your purse

### Refrain

	H7 C
	Coz' baby I made reservations
	H7 G
	Oh, i took a shower today
	A7 D7
	If you're still not getting I'm onto something
	A7 D7 G
	maybe you never will

### Vers 3

	No, I haven't done any dishes
	I don't even think it's my turn
	The fuck should I know without notice
	That I'm now your bloody intern

### Vers 4

	You might have forgotten to feed them
	Well yes, that's an issue for me
	The dreams that I thought htat were ours
	Don't reflext anymore how I feel

### Refrain

	Oh baby, I've got reservations
	And I think/fear you've got them too
	Goddamnit let's try a little harder
	...
