	i was on top of my a-game on our very first night

	the whole relationship is build upon a lie

	who could've known
	G7 G7/F# Em
	that she would get it all wrong?
	A7 D7
	and I am all innocent

## Verse

	after one hell of a dinner - with wine - it had gotten late
	and i'm not that kind of guy who is kissing on the first date
	so i walked her home and she misread the facial expressions of mine
	that's why the whole relationship is build upon a lie
	the whole relationship is build upon a lie

	i met her family - the sweetest of people - and slowly it's getting clear
	as soon as she's out of the room - her mother's looking quite funny at me
	oh she's the best cook and god knows i get sleepy when i've had a slice of that pie
	oh boy the whole relationship is build upon a lie
	the whole relationship is build upon a lie
