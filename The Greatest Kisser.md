	the whole relationship merely a lie

## Verse

	after one hell of a dinner - with wine - it had gotten late
	and i'm not that kind of guy who is kissing on the first date

	and I am all innocent

## Verse

	i met her family - the sweetest of people - and slowly it's getting clear
	when she's out of the room - her mother's looking quite funny at me
	oh she's the best cook and god knows i get sleepy when i've had a slice of that pie
	oh boy the whole relationship is build upon a lie
	the whole relationship merely a lie

	eventually she'll find out some day
	and i


	eifersüchtig, wenn ich andere leut angähne (especially her mother)

	the whole relationship is build upon a lie
	a lie a lie a lie // build upon a lie



	why my yarning face is an aphrodisiac for her
	why my yarning face is such a trigger of lust for her
	her aphrodisiac i



	why my yarning face is triggering


	when she's out of the room - then her mother's approaching me
	she's the best cook and she knows that i feel quiet sleepy right after lunch
	so i try to stifle a yawn


	each time we visit - they start to kiss it - the boy that she had brought along

	i'm still with that girl but i've got to admit she's only 2nd anymore
	a few weeks after that she took me to

	i met a girl - and i met her family - and now i'm a little confused

	each time we stay over at their place her mothers giving

	C G D G
	and put her arms around my neck
	C G D D
	her tongue between my lips
	C G D G
	her fingers crawling down my back
	C G D D
	that's the relationship

	i still don't know what exactly you mean
	we made out till the break of dawn
	way too embarressed am i to come clean
	that i was just stifling a yawn



	she pursed her lips and came so close
	i just didn't know what to do // blue // shoe // canoe // cangaroo // you // moo // poo //
	i must have looked as if i was frozen // nose // (over)dose // those // chose // rose
	why


and put her arms around my neck
her fingers crawling down my back
until she had found and pinched my cheaks
which let me make a girlish shriek

and fought a fight about whose flat





i was on top of my a-game on our very first date
listening most of the time, had smart questions but only when she ate
