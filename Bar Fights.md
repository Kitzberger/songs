# Bar Fights

Capo 0

### Verse 1

	D                                A
	well, i'm not the type starting bar fights, well, ok
	                                        D
	for sure i'm not the one who's ending them
	when i was 12 years old, riding home right after school
	this ten year old kid punched my in the face

### Chorus 1

	            G                          A
	i tried to hide inside my sweeter, so no one would see the tears
	      D                               G
	and frustration as i slowly wandered home
	    Em7             A           F#m             G
	my momma, she took care of the battle wounds i got
	       A                                D
	and i guess she wanted then to cheer me up

	when she sad something like my son, we're so proud of you today
	coz you showed everyone who is the bigger man
	apparently you're a pacifist, just like your dad and me
	so i bit the bullet putting ice on my knee

### Verse

	when all the other kids joined karake and kung-fu
	i had to go to gynastics instead
	and the very moment that i laid my hands on horror films
	my parents taped over some disney club

### Chorus 2

	i still remember like it's yesterday in kindergarden when
	the other kids reviewed bud spencer's latest shit
	it took me years to understand they'd seen different shows than i
	guess with lack of kabel that ain't no surprise

	that's why i spend so many evenings at my grandma's place coz she
	didn't give a damn what's on the telly screen
	together we watched "die hard" only sometimes granny shows
	coz she put me in charge of the remote control

### Outro (Verse)

	So if you're gonna ask me why I won't play laser tag
	or paintball or some other war games with you-u
	It's not that I don't like to shoot or kill or cause you any pain
	I simply think my momma, she would not approve.
