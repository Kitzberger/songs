# Procratination

## Chorus

	C F G C
	F Em G
	Today I didn’t do much
	But scroll up and down
	That's not exactly that
	What I am paid for

## Verse 1

	C Am Dm G 
	First I got some coffee - which helped me to realize
	that I forgot the milk - so I went back (again)

	ain't it funny how a fully automatic coffee maker
	needs an awful lot of manual work - to perform

	such a simple task of brewing me my morning coffee
	with just a little milk and not too strong
	
## Pre-Chorus
	
	E4 Dm
	i'd like to think of myself as a team player 
	G D4 E4 F
	but still I walked away when it said run the cleanup now
	
## Chorus

## Verse 2

	on my way across the floor I passed that cute intern
	i got confused and asked her for the way

	'please don't let me be like him when i am in my 30ies'
	it hurt hearing her saying that as I turned away

	i hope she thinks assisting helpless collegues feels an lot
	like working for one of those NGO

## Pre-Chorus

	...
	
## Cho

## Verse 3

	I bet even my boss - if she was fully honest
	Would rather not get up if she was me
	The other day I saw her almost having second thoughts
	before she gave that shitty task to me
	i always check if someone's standing right behind my desk
	before going online and browsing through the latest mime's
	

## Pre-Chorus

	I even tried a smoothie with organic lemon gras
	but still i felt no different 'bout these sheets

## Chorus

	Today I didn’t do much
	But scroll up and down
	Not exactly that
	What I am paid for
	
	The most creative task today
	way writing down my times
	and thinking of a text
	without lying

## Misc

### New ideas

Being extra quite
Hoping to not walk across boss or superior or colleagues
Checking if someone is standing behind me

### Old ideas

who would've guessed watching her present that latest numbers

Lets get some coffee (first/now) and then go again for milk
And see how we might feel about these sheets

First I got some coffee and went a second time for milk
but still i felt not better 'bout these sheets

We‘re the greatest movement
If we weren’t so damn lazy

Today I didn’t do much
I mostly played around
I don’t feel any guilt
For I am so bored

Inserted and deleted
Rows and lines
