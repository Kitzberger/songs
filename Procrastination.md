Today I didn’t do much
But scroll up and down
Not exactly that
What I am paid for

## Verse 1
C Am Dm G 
First I got some coffee - which helped me to realize
that I forgot the milk - so I went back/again

## Verse 2
on my way across the floor I passed that pretty intern
i got confused and asked her for the way
please don't let me be like that when i am in my thirthies 
she mumbling something like that as a turned away
i assume she thinks assisting helpless collegues feels an lot
like working for one of those NGO

## Verse 3
I bet even my boss - if she was fully honest
Would rather not get up if she was me
Lets get some coffee (first/now) and then go again for milk
And see how we might feel about these sheets

First I got some coffee and went a second time for milk
but still i felt not better 'bout these sheets

We‘re the greatest movement
If we weren’t so damn

The most creative task today
Was writing down my times
And thinking of a text
without lying




Today I didn’t do much
I mostly played around
I don’t feel any guilt
For I am so bored
