# Procratination

## Chorus

	C Fmaj7 Gsus4 C
	Fmaj7 Em G
	Today I didn’t do much
	But scroll up and down
	That's not exactly that
	What I am paid for

## Verse 1

	C Am Dm G 
	First I got some coffee - which helped me to realize
	that I forgot the milk - so I went back

	ain't it funny how a fully automatic coffee maker
	needs an awful lot of manual operations to perform

	such a simple task of brewing me my morning coffee
	with just a little milk and not too strong
	
## Pre-Chorus
	
	E4 Dm
	i'd like to think of myself as a team player 
	G D4 E4 F
	but still I walked away when it said run the cleanup now
	
## Chorus

## Verse 2

	around noon when i was half way through fighting off those mails
	i noticed all my colleagues were already on lunch break

	on my way across the floor I passed that cute intern
	i got confused and asked her for the way

	her name - it's not the one i used and neither my next try
	it got really awkward when her fellow intern walked by // her ugly friend walked by
	
	'please don't let me be like him when i am in my 30ies'
	it hurt hearing her saying that as I turned away

## Pre-Chorus

	i do hope assisting helpless collegues makes her feels a bit
	as if she's working for one of those NGO
	
## Chorus

## Verse 3

	I bet even my boss - if she was fully honest
	Would rather not get up if she was me

	The other day I saw her almost having second thoughts
	before she gave that shitty task to me

	after one extensive stay on the loo
	i highscored at candy crash

## Pre-Chorus

	I even tried a smoothie with organic lemon gras
	but still i felt no different 'bout these excel sheets

## Chorus

	Today I didn’t do much
	But scroll up and down
	Not exactly that
	What I am paid for
	
	The most creative task today
	way writing down my times
	and thinking of a text
	without lying

## Misc

### New ideas

Being extra quite
Hoping to not walk across boss or superior or colleagues
Checking if someone is standing behind me

### Old ideas

	i always check if someone's standing right behind my desk
	before going online and browsing through the latest mime's

who would've guessed watching her present that latest numbers

Lets get some coffee (first/now) and then go again for milk
And see how we might feel about these sheets

First I got some coffee and went a second time for milk
but still i felt not better 'bout these sheets

We‘re the greatest movement
If we weren’t so damn lazy

Today I didn’t do much
I mostly played around
I don’t feel any guilt
For I am so bored

Inserted and deleted
Rows and lines
