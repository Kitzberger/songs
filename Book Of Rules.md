Capo VI

### Verse 1

	G                            C 
	in order to not getting you mad or anything 
	G                          D 
	i keep using these stupid pads for my drinks 
	        G                             C 
	that i did not open up with a fork or any other tools 
	        G               D                    G 
	coz i know that around here we've got these rules 

### Verse 2

	like for instance not to put any ice cubes into your rum 
	or to try and close that door entirely like anyone 
	in their right mind would do, no, that's why i don't even try 
	to talk back to you coz after all you're right

### Chorus

	                 F            C            G
	these rules are not just made up, they're totally real 
	         F            C                 G 
	they're not just made up, they are the biggest deal 
	         F            C             G 
	they're not just made up, it's our destiny 
	    F          C                G 
	without these rules it's almost anarchy

### Verse 3

	another thing that's crucial is to not close any tabs 
	in your browser coz that's how you feel organized, perhaps 
	this is linked to your childhood when your mommy didn't tell 
	you how to buy a couch that doesn't hurt like hell 

### Verse 4

	in order to not giving you a heart attact tonite 
	we made sure all guests are on the right track, that's right 
	there's a test that we put up and every one that's coming late 
	had to take an extra class so they won't misbehave 

### Chorus

	         F            C            G 
	they're not just made up, they're totally cool 
	         F            C                     G 
	they're not just made up, i think they're chick magnets too 
	         F            C                   G 
	they're not just made up. rules help control the fun 
	          F          C                  G 
	but one step out of line, you pull the nerf gun
