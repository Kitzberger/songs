# Little Did I Know

Capo 4

## Verse

	C C7
	i saw you standing - by the fireside
	G C
	so i walked over - just to say hi

	Am Em
	you told me 'bout your weekend
	D/F# G
	little did i know

	C
	you're a cat person
	G C
	i gotta go

## Verse

	about one week later you sent me a request
	to annonce in public - our friendship manifest

	while browsing though your profile
	I then remembered - whoa

	the crazy cat person
	so i said no

## Chorus

	D7 G F C
	Please don't expect that we're becoming peers
	F Am G C
	the two of us won't happen in a million years
	F Am G C
	the two of us won't happen in a million years

## Verse

	like any great love story this needs to have a twist
	with us finding out who the other really is

	perhaps i'm mistaken
	and will have to admit

	but then you upload
	a bunch of cat pics

## Bridge

	D G
	i'm sure you're so much more complex than this
	C G D
	i bet you're so much more

	Am C
	but when i hear a kitten purr
	Em D
	when i see a ball of furr
	C C7
	i'm out

## Verse

	and according to science - it's just not meant to be
	for you fancy evil and four legged beasts

	they haunt me in my nightmares
	and just so you know

	i google ducklings
	well that's how i roll

## Chorus

## Bridge 3

	D7 G F C
	Please don't expect that we're becoming peers
	i know we're not supposed to take it as it seems

	the two of us won't happen in a million years
