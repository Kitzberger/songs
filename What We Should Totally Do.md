# What We Should Totally Do

Capo 0

## Verse

	 F#                      H 
	you and me should get a rifle gun 
	               G#m      D#m      C# 
	and then we'd go taking out bad guys 
	             H 
	oh we could do some many good things 
	      C# 
	if we only had some shoot things 
	      H            C#      F# 
	and this is where you step in 

## Verse

	since they dont have any files on you 
	meaning you managed to keep your record clean 
	it is more than obvious to me 
	that gun purchasing has to be 
	a vacancy that's just for you 

## Chorus

	           H            F#        C# 
	oh i just take my fake ID and be someone completely
	 H               F#       C# 
	different than i used to be (different paul)
	       H               F#           C# 
	well, no one needs to know my alter ego lacks a soul
 	 H           C#       F#
	hence no responsibilities.

## Solo (Verse)

## Verse

	you and me should get a monster truck 
	so traffic jams would be way more fun 
	we could enhance this boring car game 
	finding the most stupid child's name 
	and then just overrun those kids

## Chorus

## Bridge
	 F#                       H
	you and me should get plutonium
  	            G#m             D#m          C#
	and then we blow this whole place to the ground
	       H              F#              C#         G#m
	after fallout having wiped out the entire human race
	  H              C#      D#m
	eventually i'll bare my heart
	        H              C#              F#
	and suggest we have a picknick in the park.
