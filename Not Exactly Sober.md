## Verse 

	i'm not exactly over you 
	but who's to tell that this aint hell 

	for a guy afraid of dying from any sort of violence 
	a guy that doesnt know how to handle perfect silence 
	sometimes i'd better just lay down a bit (on a couch of a shrink) 
	sometimes i wonder what that might be like (and see what he thinks) 
	dont care about obama and romney 
	but i know music that makes you wanna dance coz it's funky

## Chorus

## Verse

	i got the worst hang over
	it's sure to tell this feels like hell

	my head just keeps pulsating in a steady kinda rhythm
	my stomage is a nightmare, the final drink is unforgiving
	so you want intel on the way I feel (here's a little heads-up)
	just think about sweet romance and then about (two girls and a cup)
	i might not show up for work on monday
	but i know music that makes you wanna dance coz it's funky

## Chorus
